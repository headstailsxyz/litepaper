HeadsTails (HT) is a platform, hosted on the Binance Smart Chain, where you can bet on the future on just about anything. (Not available to users in USA and Costa Rica).

## Description
HT is a crowd-powered platform for predicting future events using cryptocurrency.

Categories include politics, world events, sports, science and just about anything else!

Users can suggest their own questions for the community to predict. These questions can be considered by the team and we can make them Live if we chose to. If a user-selected question is listed on the site, the submitter gets a share of the winning prize pool. 

HT has to resolve the question (select a winning answer) within 7 days of the question end date. If we donâ€™t, users can unstake their tokens. This feature is built into the smart contract. This ensures that when users take part in a question, it will either result in the winnings to be distributed to the users or the funds can be claimed back by the users. HT cannot keep hold of the funds incase a question is not settled and winning answer not chosen.

The platform also has a points system. You get ranking points for winning bets. A global leader board shows top-ranking players. Monthly prizes will be on offer to top performers.

Users can also follow and see the dashboard of other users to see what questions they are taking part in.
